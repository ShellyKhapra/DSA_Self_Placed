<h3>Define Data Structures</h3>
<p>A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively<br>
For example, we can store a list of items having the same data-type using the array data structure</p>
The idea is to reduce the space and time complexities of different tasks. Below are list of some popular <b>linear data structures</b>.
<li>1. Array</li>
<li>2. Linked List (Singly, doubly and circular linkedList)</li>
<li>3. Stack</li>
<li>4. Queue</li>

<h3>Define Algorithm</h3>
